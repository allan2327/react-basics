##Next Steps

- **Redux**: state-management library
- **Babel**: can be used to compile JSX code to plain JavaScript (for this project, however, we use an in-browser compiler called Babel.js ... a real-world scenario would typically include a build step, maybe with Grunt or Gulp)
- **Webpack**: more complex build tool (compilation *plus* a JavaScript module system)
- **React Native**: renders to iPhone/Android
